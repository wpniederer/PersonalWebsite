I'm starting this website to expand my knowledge of web development and as a place to show off fun projects. I have a few ideas for projects I've wanted to explore, but first there's a few key items I have to work out first.

## Infrastructure

I plan to host this in AWS for sure, but the question is how to run this website with keeping costs low. AWS has many ways to host a static websites and I've dabbled in the more expensive options for what I do day-to-day. I need to do more research, but initially I've thought about doing something with Lambda similar to what's mentioned [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/serverless-websites-aws-using-lambda-api-gateway-part-skultety). The main problem with that solution is that API Gateway is expensive, but I could use an ALB instead. Another option is hosting the website [through S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS4/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).

All Infrastructure will be IaC using Terraform of course.

## CI/CD

I want CI/CD to be as cheap as possible, if not free. I get extra free runtime minutes for GitHub actions with their Pro membership, so I'll do as much as I can with those. I've heard [Harness](https://harness.io/) recently added a free membership, so I might explore that too! We'll see...

## Actual Website

I already decided to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the framework for this website, mostly because that's what we use for projects I'm on for work and would like to be able to better understand how I can help our developers.

I took advantage of a [template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) that Next.js provides for building a blog, since frontend design is not my passion. Not currently sure what else I'll need in terms of frameworks and tools, but we'll see how it goes!
